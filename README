Loom is a bzr plugin which adds new commands to manage a loom of patches.

Currently no new commands are ready for use.
The commands are:
 * loomify: This converts a branch into a loom enabled branch. As a result
   of this, the branch format is converted and you need to have the loom
   plugin installed to use it after that. The current branch nickname becomes
   the base thread in the loom.

 * create-thread: This adds a new thread to the loom with the supplied name
   and positions the branch on the new thrad.
When complete this is anticipated to be a tool similar to quilt and 
mercurial queues.
