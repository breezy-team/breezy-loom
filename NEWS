bzr-loom Release Notes
----------------------

.. contents::

IN DEVELOPMENT
==============

NOTES WHEN UPGRADING
--------------------

* bzr-loom requires bzr 2.2.0 (or very recent 2.2b releases) due to an API
  change in bzr needed to fix branching and pulling of looms. On older versions
  of bzr bzr-loom will still work for most operations but will fail when making
  new branches as part of a push or branch operation. (Robert Collins, #201613)

CHANGES
-------

* --auto is now the default on up-thread. You can supply a thread name to stop
  at a given thread, or --manual to go up a single thread. (Aaron Bentley)

FEATURES
--------

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

* Loom now takes advantage of lazy loading of bzr objects (though not to a
  complete degree), reducing the overhead of having it installed.
  (Robert Collins)

BUGFIXES
--------

* ``switch`` now accepts the ``--directory`` option. (Vincent Ladeuil, #595563)

API BREAKS

  CHANGES:

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

  BUGFIXES:

  * Stop using APIs deprecated for 2.1.0 (child progress bars for
    merge and trace.info). (Vincent Ladeuil, #528472)

  * Work with changes to bzr trunk - colocated branches and switch -r.

  API BREAKS:

  TESTING:

  INTERNALS:

  * .testr.conf added to help use with testr - still need to specify what tests
    to run. (Robert Collins)

2.0
===

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:
  
  CHANGES:

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr status`` now shows the current thread of the loom. (Jonathan
      Lange, #232465)

    * ``bzr switch`` now accepts ``top:`` and ``bottom:`` to jump to the top
      and bottom thread respectively. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr switch -b newthread`` now works. (Robert Collins, #433811)

    * ``bzr push`` now pushes the last-loom rather than creating an empty loom.
      (Robert Collins, #201613)

    * ``up`` and ``down`` are now aliases for ``up-thread`` and
      ``down-thread`` respectively.

    * ``up-thread`` now notifies when a thread becomes empty. This is a step
      towards removing it automatically/prompting to do so.
      (James Westby, #195133)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``pull`` expects the keywork local. (Mark Lee, #379347)

    * ``setup.py`` doesn't actually install. (Mark Lee, #379069)

    * module has no attribute ``PushResult``. (Robert Collins)

1.3
===

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New command ``export-loom`` allows exporting the loom threads to
      individual branches. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Running loom command on non-loom branches will now give a clean error
      rather than a traceback. (Rob Weir)

    * ``up-thread`` is now significantly faster by using more modern bzrlib
      methods. (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``up-thread`` now accepts merge type parameters such as ``--lca``.
      (Aaron Bentley)
